# Frank the Snake
  Frank the Snake is a fairly standard implementation of the classical video game Snake
  built using JavaScript, jQuery, HTMl, CSS and burritos. It's playable in modern web browsers.

## Instructions
- Move your snake (green line) around the board
- Try to eat the burritos
- Try not to eat yourself

##Controls
* ↑ arrow to move up
* ← arrow to move left
* ↓ arrow to move down
* → arrow to move right

## Implementation
  The purpose of Frank the Snake is to explore, discuss and practice good OOP design in a JavaScript-based environment, to adapt to new web techniques, and to create an extremely entertaining game.

  My UI grabs an empty element from the index file and puts an empty grid inside. The board is rendered every 100 ms, dynamically responding to the users interactions. I used jQuery's keydown event to communicate the users inputs.
